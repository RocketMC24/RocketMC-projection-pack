# RocketMC New Projection Pack

**RocketMC New Projection Pack** is a custom Minecraft modpack inspired by the Build The Earth (BTE) project and TerraPlusPlus. This modpack is designed to generate a highly detailed and accurate representation of the Earth in Minecraft, using advanced mods and real-world datasets. Whether you're constructing realistic cities or exploring natural landscapes, this pack provides everything you need to bring the real world into the blocky universe.

## Key Features

- **Major Roads, Minor Roads, and Grass Pathways:** Accurately generated from OpenStreetMap data, providing detailed road networks and pathways for realistic urban and rural planning.
- **Elevation and Biome Placement:** Utilizes public terrain datasets to faithfully recreate Earth's topography and biomes, ensuring realistic elevation and ecological zones.
- **Procedural Tree Placement:** Trees are placed automatically based on real-world vegetation data, enhancing the authenticity of forests and woodlands.
- **Realistic Oceans:** Oceans are generated based on elevation and depth data, accurately reflecting Earth's hydrology.
- **Customizable World Generation GUI:** A user-friendly interface allows you to customize world generation settings without needing additional mods like MalisisCore.
- **Teleportation by Coordinates:** Use `/tpll latitude longitude [elevation]` to instantly teleport to any real-world location, making exploration of Earth within Minecraft seamless.
- **Surface Ore Distribution:** Ores are generated just below the surface in patterns that mimic real-world geological formations, adding to the mining experience.
- **Underground Features:** Caves, dungeons, and other standard underground features are procedurally generated using CubicWorldGen as a baseline. These features are disabled by default but can be enabled and customized in the generator settings.
