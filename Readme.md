# RocketMC New Projection Pack

**RocketMC New Projection Pack** is a custom Minecraft modpack inspired by the Build The Earth (BTE) project. This pack focuses on generating a highly detailed and accurate representation of the Earth in Minecraft, utilizing advanced mods and public datasets. Whether you're building a realistic city or exploring the natural world, this modpack provides the tools you need.

## Key Features

- **1:1 Scale Earth Generation:** Experience Earth in Minecraft with a scale of 1 block per meter, replicating real-world locations accurately.
- **Real-World Elevation Data:** The terrain is generated using public datasets that match Earth's topography, including mountains, valleys, and plains.
- **Biome Mapping:** Biomes are placed according to real-world climate zones, ensuring that deserts, forests, and other biomes appear where they should.
- **Detailed Road Networks:** Major roads, minor roads, and pathways are imported directly from OpenStreetMap, allowing for precise and realistic road placement.
- **City and Building Placement:** Utilize OpenStreetMap data to generate cities and other man-made structures, enabling the creation of realistic urban landscapes.
- **Procedural Tree Placement:** Trees are automatically placed according to global vegetation data, providing realistic forests, woodlands, and other natural areas.
- **Ocean and Water Features:** Oceans, lakes, and rivers are generated based on elevation data, with realistic depth and placement reflecting Earth's hydrology.
- **Customizable World Generation:** A user-friendly GUI allows you to tweak world generation settings to match specific regions or preferences, without needing additional mods.
- **Teleportation by Coordinates:** Easily navigate the world using `/tpll latitude longitude [elevation]` to teleport to any real-world location within Minecraft.
- **Surface Ore Distribution:** Ore generation is tailored to Earth's geology, with resources appearing just below the surface in a way that mirrors real-world mineral distribution.
- **Caves and Underground Features:** Though focused on Earth's surface, the modpack includes optional underground features like caves and dungeons, generated using advanced techniques.
